# PointOfSale
Point of sale system to purchase items from inventory (a list)

An inventory list with various types of tea, that are added to a shopping cart. Stock quantity is not updated until the transaction is finalized, so you can 
cancel your purchase by clicking "VOID".

Was planning on creating a project using SQL to perform CRUD operations but decided that it might be a little too overwhelming to create a complex 
PoS app with little experience, so I will make that my next project. I plan on finishing this app using EFCore, like my previous, AppointmentManager app.
